## Battery Calculation

How to determine size battery needed for vehicle.  

1. Find current draw of each motor.  Ex: 15A
2. Calculate total current draw of vehicle.  Ex: 60A
3. Find LiPo Capacity.  Ex: 2200mAh
4. Find Constant Discharge Rate.  Ex: 25C
5. Multiply Lipo Capacity * Constant Discharge.  Ex: 
  - 2.2A*25C=55A.  For 60A vehicle, not enough.
  - 5.0A*50C=250A.  For 60A vehicle, OK
