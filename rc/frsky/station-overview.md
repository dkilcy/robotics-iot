FrSky ACCST ACCESS transmitter and receiver overview as of 09/2019 H. Renz
All new transmitters with ACCESS can also use the previous ACCST (backwards compatible!)
With ACCESS transmitters, you can use LUA script to switch from FCC to EU-LBT
Receivers with ACCESS automatically recognize whether FCC or EU-LBT and then switch over
ACCESS no longer supports D8 V8 receivers, but ACCST does (in D8 mode)
The RF transmission remains either FCC or EU-LBT (somewhat modified)
