- 1 x T4047NB20 RF Module with cooling fan
- 1 x Wiring kit

- Transmitter input power: 12VDC (11-16VDC)

### Installation

There should be two quick-release screws.  Remove the screws you can open the FR4 cover.  
You'll find terminal and some pins.  
The pin's instructions are on the back of them. On the right is GND, then 5V output, then SBUS, then PPM2, then PPM1.  
The three pins on the right can directly plug a receiver with SBUS port.  
This is the power supply terminal, and there is a positive and negative sign below.  
The input voltage supports 11-16VDC.  
You will get a power cord that looks like this.  And two servo wires.  
Due to machining problems, there will be a sharp edge, so we use PVC wire.  
If replacing other wires, pay attention to wear resistance.  
Loosen the screw counter clockwise, insert the wire, and then tighten it clockwise.  
This system can relay SBUS signals and PPM signals, so you need an SBUS receiver or a PPM receiver.  
Plug the receiver's output port into three pins on the right side.  
Then put the receiver in the box.  
The antenna can be placed inside or outside, as the cover is made of FR4 material.  
The cover needs to be installed in normal use.  
Don't forget to insall the antenna.
