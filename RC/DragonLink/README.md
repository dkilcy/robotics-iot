## DragonLink RC Setup

### V3 Transmitter


### Receiver

Link light will go blue when connected to the transmitter.  

Power the receiver with 5.0-8.4 VDC to any GRD and VCC pins on the servo connectors.

##### Connectors

From top, going left to right:

- Servo:  RSSI, Channels 12 to 1.  Signal, VIN, GND
- CEXP 2 - 5-pin GH1.25 connector
- UEXP 3 - 6-pin GH1.25 connector
- UEXP 1 - 5-pin GH1.25 connector

#### Antenna Orientation

1. The top element antenna wire MUST ALWAYS BE MOUNTED VERTICAL
2. The LOWER ( GROUND ) wire element of the antenna can be mounted horizontal on small planes and copters where there is no room to mount the bottom element vertical.

#### Telemetry/Pixhawk Setup

DragonLink recommends using only the Large 1000W Receiver due to high bandwidth utilization and for best telemetry range.
