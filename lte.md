ICCID (Integrated Circuit Card Identifier) identifies each SIM internationally. It is inscribed on the back of the SIM Card. A full ICCID is 19 or 20 characters. ICCID can be thought of as the serial number of the SIM Card. It is also considered as Issuers Identification Number. In layman's terms, it is sim cards ID number.


IMSI is unique International Mobile subscriber Indetity. It is stored inside the SIM. It consists of three part.

Mobile Country Code (MCC) : First 3 digits of IMSI gives you MCC.
Mobile Network Code (MNC) : Next 2 or 3 digits give you this info.
Mobile Station ID (MSID) : Rest of the digits. Gives away the network you are using like IS-95, TDMA , GSM etc.

Mobile network code (MNC) is used in combination with a mobile country code (MCC) (also known as a "MCC / MNC tuple") to uniquely identify a mobile phone operator/carrier.

IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number of a mobile phone is a 15 digit number unique to a mobile handset. Just key in *#06# on your mobile phone and it will display its IMEI number in most phones.

IMEI is a number, usually unique,to identify 3GPP (i.e., GSM, UMTS and LTE). The IMEI number is used by a GSM network to identify valid devices and therefore can be used for stopping a stolen phone from accessing that network. For example, if a mobile phone is stolen, the owner can call his or her network provider and instruct them to "blacklist" the phone using its IMEI number. This renders the phone useless on that network and sometimes other networks too, whether or not the phone's SIM is changed.
