### DroneID

Drone ID is a set of records created by DJI for identifying UAVs.

DJI intends to release drone ID as a public standard, but have preemptively enabled it across much of their hardware line. Through the efforts of several firmware reverse engineers (Freek van Tienen and Jan Dumon), we have the structure of the data being sent; more info is available in Freekâ€™s repository at github

A device with Drone ID enabled broadcasts the serial number, current location, height, horizontal and vertical speeds, pitch, roll, yaw, and the home location of the drone (where it took off from, and where it will return after a go-home command or loss of control.
