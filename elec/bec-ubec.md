## BEC UBEC

- BEC: Voltage regulator to convert 2/3/4S LiPo to 5V (Linear)
- UBEC: Universal BEC (Switched)

ESCs with built-in-BEC are typically linear BEC.

### Linear BEC vs Switched BEC

Linear BEC: reduces voltage to 5V by converting excess voltage to heat
Switched BEC: reduces voltage by switching on/off several thousands time per sec.  More efficent, but can induce noise, may need LC filter
