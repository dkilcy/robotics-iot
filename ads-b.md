# ADS-B: Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast

Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast (ADS–B) is a surveillance technology in which an aircraft determines its position via satellite navigation and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked.  It has two different services:

- "ADS-B In" is the reception by aircraft of FIS-B and TIS-B data and other ADS-B data 
- "ADS-B Out", each aircraft periodically broadcasts information about itself, such as identification, current position, altitude and velocity, through an onboard transmitter.
